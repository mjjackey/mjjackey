- 👋 Hi, I’m Jackey, a former medical device software engineer. Previously, I successfully contributed to developing the **world's first active magnetic‑controlled medical capsule robotic endoscope system**.
- 👀 I have 10+ years of experience specialising in mathematical algorithms and software development with a comprehensive background in computer technologies,
     mastering multiple programming languages, platforms and frameworks. I am skilled in **computer architecture and operating system knowledge, e.g. multi‑threading and multiprocessing, asynchronization, 
     memory management, modern C++, Python, OOP Design, mathematical algorithms, machine Learning and deep Learning.** I am also into AI Systems.
- 👀 In terms of my personality, I'm open‑minded, creative, diverse, and keeping pace with cutting‑edge technologies. 
      I'm interested in devising a better problem‑solving method for challenging tasks and learning new technologies and tools, if needed.
- 👀 I’m highly interested in **mathematics** and psychology. I was recognised in a **Mathematical Modelling** competition, conducted research in **Control Theory** at university,
  and earned distinctions in mathematics-related courses. Likewise, I achieved high marks in Machine Learning and Deep Learning subjects within the Data Science
  discipline. For coding, I mainly use C++ and Python. I'm also interested in **machine learning/deep learning systems(AI Systems) and efficient deep learning**. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning/deep learning systems(AI Systems) and how to start contributing to an open-source ML or DL library/Framework. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on contributing to an open-source ML or DL library/Framework.
